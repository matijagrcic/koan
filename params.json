I'm doing it to learn all about ASP.NET 5 and Aurelia. The public blog (posts, etc) will be rendered server-side using MVC 6, while the owner pages (editing posts, etc) will be done in Aurelia.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to learn this stuff too, or you'd like to contribute in some other way (e.g. design/UX expertise) then please [ping me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/markrendle).\r\n\r\nAs you might be able to tell from the initial commit, I'm not using Visual Studio for this one. Learning how to develop ASP.NET effectively on Linux is another thing I'm learning. But if you want to use Visual Studio, that's OK too.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
